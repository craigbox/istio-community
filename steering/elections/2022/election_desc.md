# 2022 Istio Steering Committee election

The Istio Steering Committee is composed of nine (9) Contribution Seats and four (4) Community Seats. The role of this election is to elect the four Community Seats to the Istio Steering Committee for a one-year term.

## Background

The Istio Steering Committee oversees the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, marketing and community health. Steering exists to allow the Technical Oversight Committee to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project.

Some direct responsibilities of steering members to consider as you are deciding whether to run or who to vote for:

- Establishing and enforcing principles to guide the Istio project.
- Fostering an environment for a healthy and happy community of developers, contributors, vendors, and users.
- Defining, evolving, and defending a Code of Conduct.
- Setting marketing and advocacy direction for the project; establishing a publishing schedule and vetting content, encouraging and assisting community members in creating content for conferences, fostering an ecosystem of vendors.
- Providing neutral mediation as appropriate to try to resolve non-technical disputes that arise as part of the project.

## Voting process

Eligibility to vote is defined in the [Steering Committee charter](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/CHARTER.md) as either:

- a project member who has had at least one Pull Request merged in the past 12 months, or
- someone who has submitted the [voting exception form](https://forms.gle/ucNfjUN6ruzJ3mL26) and has been accepted by the steering committee as having standing in the community.

You will be able to rank the candidates in the order of your preference, and
submit your ballot.  When you submit, you will be offered a chance to set a
password, which is required if you want the ability to return and re-cast
your ballot before October 16th.

All data is stored on cloud infrastructure maintained by the election officers,
and is not shared with third parties. Individual ballot data is encrypted, and
not retrievable by anyone except in aggregate form.

The top four candidates who are employed by a unique Company (as defined in the
Charter) shall be deemed to be elected.
