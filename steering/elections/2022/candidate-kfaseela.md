### Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio.

I am a comparatively new member to Istio, and have been making contributions to the project in terms of code, code reviews, design discussions and conferenece presentations for the last one year. Though my tenure has been short I was able to make contributions to the project across multiple areas including networking, security, documentation and integration tests, and is currently a Documentation Maintainer for Istio. Some of the features that I worked on include:

- Enhancing Supply Chain Security for Istio through SBOMs
- Auto SNI and SAN support
- Credential Name support for Sidecar TLS Origination
- Simplifying multiple istiod in single cluster deployments
- WorkloadSelector support for DestinationRule

I have been a speaker at the previous IstioCon, and have also conducted different sessions speaking about ServiceMesh and Istio in specific,
including a recent hoot livestream on Istio 1.14 release. I am a key member of the 5G Transformation Team in my organization, and my focus is on successfully including Istio in our 5G journey!

### Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.

I would like to represent the voice of Telco users in the Istio Community by running in this election. Though Istio has a great team leading from the forefront, I believe 5G Transofrmation is one of the major areas where Istio could play a key role, and it is quite important to represent and steer this journey at an organizational level(including the recent Ambient Mesh announcement). I have peviously served in the Steering Committee of other LinuxFoundation projects like OpenDaylight, where my responsibilities included giving high level directions for the project as well as interfacing with other CNCF projects to work out possible integrations for new innovative solutions. I have been an opensource evangelist trying to make opensource reach more and more people through University presentations, conferences, free workshops, and student mentoring. I have also served as a LinuxFoundation mentor for University Students. By being in the Steering committee, my goal would be to bring more traction for Istio among new comers, students, and of course 5G Telco users. I would also be interested in improving the "Women in Istio" community by offering all technical/non-technical support. As Istio is stepping towards being a CNCF member, I would be happy to apply my previous experience being part of similar projects, and steer better visibility for Istio.
