### About me

I led Istio's transfer to, and [graduation within](https://istio.io/blog/2023/istio-graduates-within-cncf/), the CNCF.

I worked on Cloud Native at Google for 8 years, including a primary focus on Istio from 2020 until I left in 2022. For the last 12 months, I have held a Community Seat - ARMO is not involved in the Istio project but supports my continued involvement. On the Steering Committee, I do a lot of project administration, including coordinating between vendors, managing our events strategy, and mentoring new project leaders. 

Other things I've done for Istio include designing its web site, writing release announcements, supporting the creation of the GAMMA project, and chairing IstioCon. (See [here](https://elections.istio.io/app/elections/2022/candidates/craigbox) for a full list.)

### Why I'm running

I continue to enjoy being involved in administering the Istio project, and provide context and continuity within the leadership group. As Istio moves into its next phase as a graduated CNCF project, and the Ambient Mesh project moves to production readiness, there will be work required to update our messaging to the market. I look forward to helping with this.
